\begin{itemize}
    \item Proper sanitation is paramount! Ensure your system is cleaned: before and after each growing cycle; if excessive growth of algae, fungus, or biofilm occurs; or if you notice any other signs of bacterial, fungal, algal, or other unwanted contamination. This is to minimize the risk of hazardous pathogens both to your plants \textbf{and} to you.
    \item Remember that your tower is a water vessel. To minimize risk in the event of a spill, place your tower well away from electrical devices, electrical outlets, and any other items which may be damaged by water or which may present a hazard in the presence of water.
    \item The components of your tower are not dishwasher-safe.
    \item Your tower is designed only to be placed indoors. Placing your tower outdoors may result in damage.
